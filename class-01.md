Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

html is parsed first then css and javascript is read next since the links for it are normally referenced within HTML via the link and script elements. The browser then produces an inmememory DOM (for html) tree and CSSOM (for CSS) structure. Then compiles and executes the parsed Java script.

How to start to design a Website.

What is the first step to designing a Website?

project ideation.

What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

What do I want to accomplish

Semantics.

Why should you use an  h1 element over a span  element to display a top level heading?

because it gets the most benefits and it's semantically considered more important despite the fact that they look the same.

What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

* search engines consider your content important

* it is suggested to the developer what type of data will be populated

* it's easier to find meaningful code instead of searching through div tags


Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?

 # Things I want to know more about or find interesting

* are they're other ways to get the search engine to view your content as important?

* can you use the span element(like the h1 element but not as important) more than once?

* one reason it is not recommended to pollute your html with JS is because it is difficult to get scripts to load at the correct time

* /* content /* will comment out the content in JS
