Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

We no longer have to rely on plugin technologies to handle them

Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
the src attribute is a path to the embedded file (exact same function as when its on img)
contorol attribute is to control video and audio playback (essential for users with epilepsy)

Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

so that the user can still view the video even if their browser doesn't support it (link to video is a fallback)

Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
Audio and Video are in a toxic environment where they can't function. After a while their friend Link comes to guide them to a more suitable environment.

Responsive Images

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
-so you can see it on any screen no matter how large.

Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
srcset: defines the set of images that the browser is allowed to choose between
sizes: defines the conditions of the media, this would be used when viewing a website on a desktop vs a phone

How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
Because Css and Javascript are too fast to correctly read the conditions.
