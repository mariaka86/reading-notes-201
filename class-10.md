# Reading notes 10
Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

a syntax error is equivalent to a spelling error (forgetting the dang semicolon)

a logic error is when your code runs, but doesn't do what you wanted to do (at least your "spelling" is correct though).

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- forgetting semicolons
- forgetting curly braces to indicate a function
- mispelling variables and functions
...etc
How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

It'll help with troubleshooting and building up exposure to errors is important.
The JavaScript Debugger.

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? 
"it's like autocorrect but for code"

Define what a breakpoint is.
a breakpoint is where you pause the code in the middle of execution to evaluate errors before it continues.

What is the call stack?
the call stack helps you determine what code has already ran to get to a certain point.


## Things I want to know more about/notes

- I should definitely utilize breakpoints and call stacks more
- do all IDE come with a debugger?
