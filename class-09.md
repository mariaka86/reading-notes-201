HTML Forms
Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

Why are forms so important in web development?

because they're one of the main ways for users to interact with a website and they allow users to enter data.

When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

ask data that you absolutely need(focused) and keep the form simple 

List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
form - makes itself known as a form and specific for forms
label- encompases all the data entry portion (ex: <label for="name">Name:</label>)
input- contains the attribute type which is very important as it determines how content will behave(ex:<input type="email" id="mail" name="user_email">)

Introduction To Events.

How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

an action that has occured because of your code.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

the name of the event and a function to handle the event. 

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

because it specifically targets that element and not the whole page.

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturi
event capturi has the browser check if the parent of the element (click) has an event handler and runs it, then it moves on to the immediate ancestor and so on until it reaches the html element. event bubbling does the opposite and starts at the html element and moves down into the parent.


## Things I want to know more about
- Does the button function get more complex because of using forms or is this how it normally is?
