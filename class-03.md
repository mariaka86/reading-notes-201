Learn CSS
The Box Model.

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

Padding: "The one who keeps the content away from the elements"
Margin: "The one who keeps the elements away from the content"


List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content Box: (The area where you can size your content)
- Padding Box:( White space that sits around the content)
- Border Box:(wraps around content and padding)
- Margin Box:( outermost layer that wraps around content, padding and border. Separates the box from other elements as whitespace)


Learn JS
Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

What data types can you store inside of an Array?

strings, numbers, objects and other Arrays

Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

Yes, by chaining two sets of square brackets together. 

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

- x *= f()- multiplies var by the right operand

- x /= f()- divides var by the right operand

- x %= f() -assigns remainder of division results to variable

- x **= f()- raises the value of var to the power of the right operand.

- x <<= f()- shifts bits to the left and assigns them to f()
Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

when asking the user a yes or no question.

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

in animation and deciding how long a certain animation/ action should run.
